# Ros-2-simulated-robot.
A ros 2 simulated robot.

NOTE: You can also use a cad design software(FUSION 360, SOLIDWORKS......) to design the robot and export to ROS  and also ROS 2,but this is just a repository that describes how to design a robot manually, by writing .xacro files which are said to be robot meshes.

Fisrt step in building the differential-drive robot:

Launch the Node:
```
  ros2 launch <name_of_package> robot.launch.py
```

The joint state publisher node must be launched/be active when launching the robot in rviz2.
```
  ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui
```

Open Rviz2:
```
  ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
```

Set the fixed frame to "base_link".

The centre of the robot which is the "base_link".

Plugins used in simulation of the robot can be gotten from:
https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins


STEPS TO TAKE TO GET THE ROBOT UP AND READY:
1. Launch the robot_state_publisher in simulation mode.
2. Launch Gazebo.
3. Spawn the robot into Gazebo.

Set the sim time to true,we dealing with simulation.So our the boolean has to be true.
```
   ros2 launch robot robot.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
```
Start up Gazebo:
```
   ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py 
```

# SPAWNING THE ROBOT INTO GAZEBO:
     To spawn the robot into gazebo, launch the file called show.robot.launch.py (Note: launch files in ROS 2 are python scripts/files)
 Command:
 ```
   ros2 launch robot show.robot.launch.py
 ```
 Check if the topics are available.This list all topics which are available:
 ```
   ros2 topic list
 ```
 Now,we can drive the robot around once we use the teleop_twist_keyboard node to publish to the "/cmd_vel" topic that the robot subscribes to.
 
 ```
   ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard  teleop_twist_keyboard
 ```
 
 You can give colour to the robot,by adding colour to the .xacro file.Video decription below,while using the teleop_twist_keyboard to drive the robot.
 
 We can also write a python script that publish certain velocity to make the robot move and also perform some basic task.
 Create a ROS 2 package called drive_robot ,its dependecies on rclpy,the package should be created in the src directory of your workspace.
 
 ```
   cd src
 ```
 
 ```
   ros2 pkg create drive_robot --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy
 
 ```
 Run the node in the pasckage to make the robot drive forward, in linear of x.
 ```
   ros2 run drive_robot velocity_drive
 ```

# LAUNCHING SAVED GAZEBO WORLD WITH ROBOT SPAWNED IN IT.
 ```
    ros2 launch robot show.robot.launch.py world:='path to where you saved your Gazebo world'
 ```

You can check the TF2 TREE:
```
  ros2 run rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
```

# To LAUNCH THE WORLD:
 
```
   ros2 launch robot show.robot.launch.py world:="path to the .world file"
```
Mine is:
```
  ros2 launch robot show.robot.launch.py world:=/home/magnum/simuate_ws/src/robot/worlds/new.world
```

# SLAM 
Run the slam_toolbox node.
```
  ros2 launch robot online_async.launch.py 
```
